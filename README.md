The Pig game is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a single die, aiming to score points without rolling a 1. Players 
can roll as many times as they want in a turn, adding their rolls to a running total. If a player rolls a 1, they lose their turn's
score. The first player to reach 100 points wins. The game is often used to teach probability concepts and decision-making strategies.\n
